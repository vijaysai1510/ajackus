# User Management System

## Project Overview
The User Management System is a **Vite + React** application designed to efficiently manage users. It provides functionality to add, edit, and delete users while maintaining a clean and responsive user interface.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn as the package manager

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to the development server URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Directory Structure and Components

### `App.jsx`
- The root component of the application.
- Manages the global state for user data, modal visibility, and user selection.
- Dynamically switches between the `UserForm` and `UserList` components based on user actions.

### `components/`
- **`UserForm.jsx`**: 
  - A form for adding or editing users.
  - Dynamically adapts to new user creation or editing an existing user.
  - Includes validation and smooth animations using the `react-reveal` library.
- **`UserList.jsx`**: 
  - Displays the list of users in a responsive table.
  - Provides options to edit or delete users.
  - Handles empty states gracefully.
- **`Modal.jsx`**: 
  - A reusable modal component for displaying forms or additional content.
  - Controlled by the `isOpen` and `onClose` props.
- **`ErrorBoundary.jsx`**:
  - A component to catch and display errors gracefully for any child components.

---

## Key Features
- **Vite + React**: The application is built using Vite for faster development and React for the component-based architecture.
- **React Functional Components**: All components are written as functional components with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components like `Modal` and `ErrorBoundary` ensure reusability and scalability.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations integrated with `react-reveal`.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: A responsive, modern design using utility-first styling.

## Challenges Faced

1. **State Management**:
   - Managing shared states like user data and modal visibility across components.
   - Solution: State management is centralized in `App.jsx` for consistency.

2. **Dynamic Form Handling**:
   - Supporting both adding and editing users in a single form.
   - Solution: Conditional rendering and controlled form inputs in `UserForm.jsx`.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Ensuring the app remains performant during development and in production.
   - Solution: Leveraged Viteâ€™s blazing-fast development environment and optimized bundling.

---

## Potential Improvements

1. **Data Persistence**:
   - Integrate with a backend or local storage to save user data across sessions.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Expand the use of `ErrorBoundary.jsx` across the app for global error management.

3. **Form Validation**:
   - Add more robust validation logic for user inputs (e.g., regex validation for email and phone numbers).

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and handle edge cases effectively.
